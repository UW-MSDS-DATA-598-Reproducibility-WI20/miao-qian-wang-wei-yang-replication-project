## Contents
The goal of this project is to complete a professional, publication-worthy replication of a [public health paper](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7780-3).<br />
The paper claims that indirect approaches can introduc bias to under-5 mortality (U5M) estimation in populations affected by HIV/AIDS and their predictive model enables correction of the bias. It is important to us to replicate this paper because its foundings can create a substantial impact on public health, especially regarding policies and programs related to the HIV epidemics. <br />
