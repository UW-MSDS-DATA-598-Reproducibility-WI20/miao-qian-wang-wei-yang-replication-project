# Contributing to DATA598A_final_project

This outlines how to propose a change to DATA598A_final_project. For more detailed
info about contributing to this, and other tidyverse packages, please see the
[**development contributing guide**](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib).

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the text file.

### Prerequisites

Before making  a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you have found a
bug, create an associated issue in the repo.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.
The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.  
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.
* Details of how to make a Pull request is documented [here]('./misc/how-to-create-pull-request.md')
