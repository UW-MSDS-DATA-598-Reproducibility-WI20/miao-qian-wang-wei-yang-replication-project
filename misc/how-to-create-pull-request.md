## Overview
This document describes the simple steps to create a PullRequest for us to collaborate on this project. It's assuming we are all contributors of this [repo](https://github.com/mshhh/DATA598A_final_project) and all cloned it locally.

## Why do I need a PullRequest
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

## Specification
1. Create your new local branch: `git checkout -b <your_branch_name>`
  -  `git checkout -b FB-MyName-NewFeature`
2. Push this new branch to a new remote branch. `git push origin <your_branch_name`
  - `git push origin FB-MyName-NewFeature`

In Github console

3. Create a Pull Request from Git repository page
4. Merge a Pull Request after reviewing the code change
5. Delete the remote branch (optional)

In CampusWire team chat

6. Ping the group of the Pull Request and seek approval before merge. (Optional but recommended for feature change or if you are working in parallel on the same file with other contributors)
