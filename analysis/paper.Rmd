# Introduction
Generalized linear model (GLM) is a widely used method in research. It is well-established with high flexibility and relatively straightforward interpretation. However, GLMs usually require making assumptions and having the underlying assumptions not hold could invalidate the whole model. 

The application of GLM can be observed in many fields including public health. @quattrochi2019 introduced an GLM via penalized maximum likelihood to correct the under-5 mortality (U5M) in populations affected by HIV/AIDS. This method was developed since the U5M is commonly estimated using survey-based approaches in less developed regions and it is based on a fundamental assumption that the mother's survival is not related to her children's, which is often violated in populations affected by HIV/AIDS. Therefore, the author sought a method to correct this bias using GLM. 

In our work, we present our endeavor to replicate the model building and regression analysis introduced in @quattrochi2019. In the meantime, we attempted using different parameters in both constructing the model and applying it to test how robust the original method was. We will in this paper report our method and results from the replication attempt.

# Methods

## Overview
The original model was implemented in R (v3.5.2) [team2013r] with web application (https://johnquattrochi.com/bias/) to show that indirect method such as surveying can underestimate U5M by 0-41% in populations where 0-40% of the people are affected by HIV/AIDS. The model was written using the R language [team2013r] and some of the main packages used were tidyverse (v1.2.1) and foreach (v1.4.4). The original implementation utilized the doReids package (v1.1.1) that offers a back-end server for parallel processing that was not adopted in our replication due to the limitation in resources. In order to complete the simulation for constructing the model in a reasonable time frame without parallel computing, we reduced the number of populations used in the simulation input from 4480 to 1000. The code provided the author on Github (https://github.com/jquattro/hiv-childmort-bias) was mostly well-organized and documented. However, we discovered some mistakes regarding output inconsistency and wrong variable names. Despite the debugging process, we were able to replicate the implementation.
